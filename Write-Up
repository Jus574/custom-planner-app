The widget i have added is a stopwatch it is a vital widget in a planner as time is the most precious thing for us and we need something to keep track of that time. my stopwatch widget will help keep track of that time. if you are doing something you could start the stopwatch widget and do the work so later on once your work is completed you can comeback and check how much time has passed and based on the time taken you could plan for the next day when you are doing that work. so i think this is a great widget. i have used the same code as in our quest number 1 i have made a few changes to reduce the stopwatch from multiple to single stopwatch by removing the array also i have made a few styles changes in app.css to accomadate the stopwatch widget.
